    "BLINDNESS" : {
      "CAUSES" : "Blindness can be caused due to numerous conditions, the leading causes are: \nThe leading causes of chronic blindness include cataract, refractive errors, glaucoma, corneal opacities, age-related macular degeneration, trachoma, childhood blindness and diabetic retinopathy. \nCataract is the opacification of the lens in the eye and in advanced cases a whitish reflex can be seen in the eye. The most important symptom is painless progressive blurring of vision. \nRefractive errors occur when the rays of light entering the eye do not focus onto the retina, the part of the eye on which the image forms. This is a very important cause of poor vision in children. \nGlaucoma occurs when the pressure of the eye is increased and that causes progressive loss of sight. It is very important to identify and treat glaucoma as the vision lost is irreversible. \nIn corneal opacities the clear part of the eye in the front through which the light enters the eye becomes opaque and the patient cannot see. \nThe type of partial vision loss may differ, depending on the cause: \nWith cataracts, vision may be cloudy or fuzzy, and bright light may cause glare. \nWith diabetes, vision may be blurred, there may be shadows or missing areas of vision and difficulty seeing at night. \nWith glaucoma, there may be tunnel vision and missing areas of vision. \nWith macular degeneration, the peripheral (side) vision is normal but the central vision is slowly lost.",
      "DIAGNOSIS" : "There are two main areas that are looked at when someone's vision is measured:\n    Visual acuity – It is central vision and is used to look at objects in detail, such as reading a book or watching television\n        Visual field – It is the ability to see around the edge of vision while looking straight ahead.\n    Visual field testing\n    During visual field testing one will be instructed to look straight ahead at a device while lights are flashed on and off in peripheral vision. Person will be asked to press a button every time you see a light. This shows any gaps in his field of vision. \nTest for visual acuity \nA Snellen chart is used to measure visual acuity. It involves reading letters off a chart on which the letters become progressively smaller. This chart is used during a routine eye test. After the test, a score made up of two numbers is given. The first number represents how far away from the chart were able to successfully read the letters on the chart. The second number represents how far away a person with healthy vision should be able to read the chart. \nSo if you were given a visual acuity score of 6/60, it means you can only read 6 meters away what a person with healthy eyesight can read 60 meters away. The normal eyesight is 6/6. \nPartial sight impairment \nPartial sight, or sight impairment, is usually defined as:\n    Having very poor visual acuity (3/60 to 6/60) but having a full field of vision\n    Having a combination of moderate visual acuity (up to 6/24) and a reduced field of vision or having blurriness or cloudiness in your central vision\n    Having relatively good visual acuity (up to 6/18) but a lot of your field of vision is missing \nSevere sight impairment (blindness) \nThe legal definition of severe sight impairment (blindness) is when 'a person is so blind that they cannot do any work for which eyesight is essential'. \nThis usually falls into one of three categories:\n    Having extremely poor visual acuity (less than 3/60) but having a full field of vision\n    Having poor visual acuity (between 3/60 and 6/60) and a severe reduction in your field of vision \n    Having average visual acuity (6/60 or better) and an extremely reduced field of vision",

      "DIAGNOSIS" : "Based on  history, symptoms, physical and neurological examination, techniques like MRI, CT scan, angiogram or spinal tap may assist in diagnosis.\n    Neurologic exam: It includes testing of vision, hearing, alertness, muscle strength, coordination, and reflexes. Eyes  are looked for swelling, caused by a tumour pressing on the nerve that connects the eye and the brain.\n    Angiogram: It is an imaging technique in which dye is injected into the bloodstream. If a tumour is present, the image may show the tumour or blood vessels that are feeding into the tumour.\n    Spinal tap: For diagnosis, sample of cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid that fills the spaces in and around the brain and spinal cord) is usually collected by a technique called lumbar puncture. For this process, a long, thin needle is used to remove fluid and it takes about 30 minutes. \n    MRI and CT scan are very useful imaging techniques in the diagnosis of brain tumour.",

It has been seen that breast cancer is most common in the women over 50 who have been through menopause. \nLevels of estrogen: When the  body is exposed to high levels of estrogen. This may happen due to early start of periods and late menopause. Also not having children or having children at later age may also increase the  risk of developing breast cancer as body is exposure to estrogen is uninterrupted by pregnancy. \nFamily history: If there is a history of breast cancer or ovarian cancer in the family, there may be higher risk of developing breast cancer. Particular genes, known as BRCA1 and BRCA2, can increase the risk of developing both breast and ovarian cancer. It is possible for these genes to be passed on from a parent to their child. Third gene (TP53) is also associated with increased risk of breast cancer. \nAlcohol: The risk of developing breast cancer is also associated with the amount of alcohol one drinks. \nSmoking: The risk of smoking is associated with breast cancer  \nRadiation: Certain medical procedures that use radiation, such as X-rays and CT scans, may slightly increase risk of developing breast cancer.",
      "DIAGNOSIS" : " Contact your physician: If there is any kind of symptoms like lump or change in shape or color of breast. Than you should contact your physician. \nImaging: Mammography and breast ultrasound scan are also used to diagnose the breast cancer. Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your breasts. The image produced will show any lumps or abnormalities present in your breasts. Your doctor may also suggest a breast ultrasound if they need to know whether a lump in your breast is solid or contains liquid. \nMicroscopic analysis: A biopsy is generally done when mammograms and other imaging tests, or the physical exam finds a breast change (or abnormality) that is possibly cancer.

Once a burn is completely cooled, apply a lotion, such as one that contains aloe vera or a moisturizer. This helps prevent drying and provides relief. \nBandage the burn. Cover the burn with a sterile gauze bandage (not fluffy cotton). Wrap it loosely to avoid putting pressure on burned skin.

      "SYMPTOMS" : " Symptoms of burn depend on the depth of the burn. Burns can be divided into three types. \nFirst degree or superficial burns involves the upper skin layer. They produce redness (erythema) and pain (tenderness). Blisters are absent. They are typically caused by exposure of the unprotected skin to solar radiation (sun burn) or to brief contact with hot substances, liquids or flash flames (scalds). First-degree burns heal within a week with no permanent changes in skin colour, texture, or thickness. \nSecond degree or partial thickness burns affect deeper skin layers.

      "DIAGNOSIS" : " Cancers can generally be recognized by appearance of signs and symptoms through screening. \nScreening: Screening tests help in detecting cancer at an early stage (before the symptoms appear). When abnormal tissue or cancer is found early, it is easy to treat or cure. By the time symptoms appear, the cancer might have grown and spread. This can make the cancer harder to treat or cure. It is important to remember that when a doctor suggests any screening test, it does not always mean  that there is a  cancer. People with suspected cancer are investigated with medical tests. These tests include Blood tests, X-rays, MRIs, Biopsy, Pap-smears, CT scans and Endoscopy and many more.",

Rarely, transmission may occur from skin lesions or articles soiled with discharges from lesions of infected persons (fomites). \nIncubation period is 2-6 days, occasionally longer.",
      "DIAGNOSIS" : " DIAGNOSIS of diphtheria is usually made on the basis of clinical presentation since it is imperative to begin presumptive therapy quickly. \nThe laboratory DIAGNOSIS includes: \na) Isolation of the organism from clinical specimens (throat and nasal swabs and swabs can be collected from the skin lesions and wounds, in case of cutaneous diphtheria) \ni) Microscopic examination of stained smears (Grams staining or Alberts staining) prepared from swabs. \nii) Culture- Any suspected isolates of C.diphtheriae during culture should be subjected to the following tests \n1. Biotyping \n2. Toxigenicity testing (Elek's test) \n3. Antibiotic susceptibility test by Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) (E test) method. \nb) Serological tests -Demonstration of a fourfold rise in antibody titre in paired sera samples collected 10-14 days apart (Both samples are to be collected before administration of either diphtheria toxoid or antitoxin) using either Indirect haemagglutination (IHA) test or Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay( ELISA) test.",

The additional genetic material CAUSES physical and developmental characteristics associated with Down syndrome. There are three forms of Down syndrome, although the effects of each type are usually similar. \nTrisomy 21 is the most common type. Trisomy 21 is generally seen due to every cell in the body has an extra copy of chromosome 21 (trisomy is a Greek word that means ‘third copy’). \nTranslocation is caused when a piece of chromosome 21 attaches itself to another chromosome in a cell. \nMosaicism is the least common type.

It is rarely due to exposure to enclosed arc light since the glass globe absorbs the most deleterious light rays. \nSnow blindness: It is produced by reflected ultraviolet rays from snow surface. In snow blindness, the cause is similar, since the ultraviolet rays are reflected from snow surfaces. Snow reflects 85% of ultraviolet radiations, increasing the radiation exposure of cornea. The higher the altitude, more ultraviolet radiation is absorbed because the radiation traverses the thin air easily. \nShort circuiting: This is due to exposure to bright light being produced on short circuiting. \nThe essential pathology is the desquamation of corneal epithelium resulting in multiple erosions.",

    "PLAGUE" : {
      "CAUSES" : "Plague is caused by Yersinia pestis (non-motile, non-acid fast, non spore forming, gram-negative cocco-bacillus). Y. pestis is easily destroyed by sunlight, high temperatures, and disinfectants. \nVectors of plague- Fleas are the natural vectors of plague in the world. In India, the important fleas for plague transmission are Xenopsylla cheopis, X. astia and X. brasiliensis. Out of these X. cheopis is the principal vector. \nReservoir of infection – Wild rodents are the natural hosts of Y. pestis. At least 220 species of rodents which inhabit mountains, plains, deserts, cultivated fields and forests in both temperate and tropical climate are known to be infected with plague bacillus. Tatera indica among the wild rodents and Rattus norvegicus and R.rattus among the commensal rodents play an important role as reservoir of Y. pestis. In India Tatera indica acts as a main reservoir of infection, not the domestic rat (R.rattus).Generally the infection is maintained by the resistant species of the wild rodents. The susceptible rodents die due to the disease. \nMode of transmission-Flea bites-Plague bacteria are mostly transmitted by bite of an infected flea. During plague epizootics (occurrence of disease at higher rates than expected, in animal population), many rodents die, and causing hungry fleas to seek other sources of blood. People and animals that visit places where rodents have recently died from plague are at risk of being infected from flea bites. Dogs and cats may also bring plague-infected fleas into the home. Flea bite exposure may result in primary bubonic or septicaemic plague. \nContact with contaminated fluid or tissue- Humans can become infected when handling tissue or body fluids of a plague-infected animal without using proper precautions such as hunters. This type of transmission results in bubonic plague or septicaemic plague. \nInfectious droplets- Infected droplets from a case of pneumonic plaque can infect other person. Contact with infected cats can transmit the infection to humans by droplet infection.",
      "DIAGNOSIS" : "When plague is suspected, clinical specimens should be collected immediately and specific antimicrobial treatment should be started before confirmation of laboratory DIAGNOSIS. Routine diagnostic specimens for smear and culture include the following: whole blood; aspirates from suspected buboes; pharyngeal swabs, sputum samples or tracheal washes (from those with suspected plague pharyngitis or pneumonia); and cerebrospinal fluid (from those with suspected meningitis). \nSmear examination-During epidemics or epizootics, the examinations of smears (stained with Wayson's stain) that show the presence of characteristic bipolar stained plague bacilli are helpful in preliminary DIAGNOSIS. \nFluorescent antibody (FA) staining- the smears should be stained with the fluorescent-antibody test (FA). \nCulture-Samples collected for culture can be transported to laboratory in Cary-Blair transport medium then cultured on other biological media. Presence of bacilli can be confirmed by Bacteriophage Lysis Test. \nSerology- Presence of a single high titre of plague antibody in individual who has not been vaccinated earlier gives a presumptive DIAGNOSIS of plague. Whereas a fourfold rise in antibody in two serum samples collected at least 10 days apart gives the confirmation of plague DIAGNOSIS. \nOther tests- Polymerase Chain Reaction for the detection of selected Yesinia pestis genes, ELISA based rapid serological tests, animal inoculation. \nLaboratory diagnostic categories for human plague are as follows: \nCase definitions: \nSuspect plague: \nCompatible clinical and epidemiological features \nSuspicious organisms seen or isolated from clinical specimens. \nPresumptive plague \nY. pestis F1 antigen detected in clinical materials by direct fluorescent antibody testing, or by some other standardized antigen detection method;or \nisolate from a clinical specimen demonstrates biochemical reactions consistent with Y. pestis or Polymerase chain reaction(PCR) positivity;or \n a single serum specimen is found positive for diagnostic levels of antibodies to Y. pestis F1 antigen, not explainable on the basis of prior infection or immunization. \nConfirmed plague: \nisolate identified as Y. pestis by phage lysis of cultures; or \na significant (a 4-fold or greater) change in antibody titre to the F1 antigen in paired serum specimen \nPost-mortem specimens, specimens from rodent tissues, flea specimens, and soil specimens are also used to determine the eco-epidemiology of the infection.",

      "SYMPTOMS" : "Incubation period (time taken between catching an infection and appearance of SYMPTOMS) of the disease is 3-7 days. Disease starts with flu like SYMPTOMS such as sudden onset of fever, chills, head and body-aches and weakness, vomiting and nausea. \nDepending on the route of infection, there are three forms of plague: bubonic, septicaemic and pneumonic. \nBubonic plague is the most common form of plague and is caused by the bite of an infected flea usually on the lower extremities. Plague bacillus (Y. pestis), enters at the bite site and travels through the lymphatic system to the nearest lymph node where it proliferates. The lymph node then becomes inflamed, tense and painful, swollen and is called a bubo. The most usual place for this swelling is the groin, but it also occurs in the armpits and the neck. At advanced stages of the infection the inflamed lymph nodes can turn into suppurating open sores. Bubonic plague cannot spread from person to person. \nSepticaemic plague occurs when infection spreads directly through the bloodstream without forming a bubo. Septicaemic plague may result from flea bites and from direct contact with infective materials through cracks in the skin. Advanced stages of the bubonic form of plague will also lead to direct spread of Y. pestis in the blood. \nPneumonic plague-or lung-based plague- It is less common form of plague and is caused by spread of infection to the lungs from advanced bubonic plague. It is highly infectious and can spread from human to human via infected air droplets or through infected clothing and other contaminated articles. Untreated pneumonic plague has a very high case-fatality ratio."

This is known as abortive poliomyelitis, and is characterized by complete recovery in less than a week. Three SYMPTOMS observed with this form of poliovirus infection are upper respiratory tract infection (sore throat and fever) ,gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea,vomiting,abdominal pain,constipation or diarrhea) and influenza-like illness. \n1-2% of polio infections leads to Nonparalytic aseptic meningitis(SYMPTOMS of stiffness of the neck, back, and/or legs), usually following several days after the above mentioned SYMPTOMS similar to that of minor illness. Increased or abnormal sensations can also occur. Typically these SYMPTOMS will last from 2 to 10days, followed by complete recovery. \nFewer than 1% of all polio infections result in flaccid paralysis which is a clinical manifestation characterized by weakness or paralysis and reduced muscle tone  . Paralytic SYMPTOMS generally begin 1 to 10 days after minor illness SYMPTOMS and progress for 2 to 3 days. Generally, no further paralysis occurs after the temperature returns to normal. Some signs and SYMPTOMS can include a loss of superficial reflexes, initially increased deep tendon reflexes and severe muscle aches and spasms in the limbs or back. The illness progresses to flaccid paralysis with diminished deep tendon reflexes, reaches a plateau without change for days to weeks, and is usually asymmetrical. Strength then begins to return. Patients do not experience sensory losses or changes in cognition. \nMany persons with paralytic poliomyelitis recover completely and in most cases muscle function returns to some degree. Weakness or paralysis still present 12 months after onset is usually permanent."

Women with PCOS are more likely to have a mother or sister with PCOS. \nA main underlying problem with PCOS is a hormonal imbalance. In women with PCOS, the ovaries make more androgens than normal. Androgens are male hormones that females also make. High levels of these hormones affect the development and release of eggs from ovary each month (process called ovulation). \nResearchers also think insulin may be linked to PCOS. Insulin is a hormone that controls the change of sugar, starches, and other food into energy for the body to use or store. Many women with PCOS have too much insulin in their bodies because they have problems using it.

Those who had more severe polio and who recovered more function are more likely to be strongly affected by PPS. \nAlthough the cause of PPS is debated, the common theory is that it is the result of the slow weakening of nerve cells in the spinal cord that were damaged by the polio virus. Overworking these weakened neurons over time leads to even more damage, eventually giving rise to PPS. SYMPTOMS of PPS can appear anywhere from 10 to 40 years after initial polio attack. The average time of onset is about 30 years after initial polio attack. \nPPS is not an infectious disease- it cannot spread from one person to another.

    "RHEUMATIC FEVER AND RHEUMATIC HEART DISEASE" : {

During infection the immune system fights the infection by producing antibodies to proteins on the surface of the bacteria. In certain strains of group A streptococcal bacteria, the proteins on the bacteria appear similar to proteins in the human cells and the immune system begins to attack human cells with similar proteins such as heart, joints, skin. \nRF and RHD are epidemiologically associated with Streptococcus pyogenes pharyngitis. Streptococci are a large group of gram-positive, nonmotile, non–spore-forming cocci about 0.5-1.2 µm in size. \nStreptococcus pyogenes CAUSES a wide variety of diseases in humans. It is one of the most common CAUSES of acute bacterial pharyngitis that leads to RF/RHD. Impetigo, a common skin infection, is also caused by S. pyogenes and is associated with acute glomerulonephritis (AGN). In rare cases, S. pyogenes CAUSES invasive diseases such as cellulitis, bacteremia, necrotizing fasciitis, and toxic shock syndrome (TSS). \nThe risk of an attack of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) following GAS pharyngitis has been reported to be 0.3% under endemic conditions to 3% during epidemic conditions. During the winter and spring seasons in temperate climates, up to 20% of the school-aged children may be GAS carriers.

      "DIAGNOSIS" : "There is currently no single test to diagnose acute rheumatic fever (ARF). DIAGNOSIS is based on clinical assessment and the identification of a number of signs and SYMPTOMS that are associated with the illness.

These include fever, arthralgia (generalised joint aches), blood tests that suggest general illness (elevated ESR), and changes seen on electrocardiogram (Increased P-R interval). \nJones criteria for the DIAGNOSIS of rheumatic fever-The Jones criteria were introduced in 1944 as a set of clinical guidelines for the DIAGNOSIS of rheumatic fever (RF). According to revised Jones criteria, the DIAGNOSIS of RF can be made when two of the major criteria or one major criterion plus two minor criteria, are present along with evidence of Streptococcal infection (Streptococcal serum antibody tests). \nRheumatic heart disease (RHD) is most accurately diagnosed using ultrasound.

The mite is very small, barely visible to the naked eyes. \nScabies mites burrow into the top layer of the skin (epidermis), where the adult female lays eggs. The presence of mite proteins and faeces triggers an allergic reaction in the patient causing an intense itch. \nScratching can lead to infection of the skin with bacteria (particularly Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogens), leading to the development of skin sores (impetigo). Impetigo can be complicated into deeper skin infection such as abscesses and immune-mediated complications as acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (kidney disease) and possibly rheumatic heart disease. Up to 10% of children with infected scabies may show renal damage in resource-poor settings and, in many, this persists for years following infection resulting to permanent kidney damage. Recurrent infestations are common. \nTransmission of scabies- \nScabies is usually transmitted by direct, skin to skin contact from infected person to another person; such as holding a baby, sexual activity, sharing a bed, school children holding hands. Close interpersonal contact is the main way of transmission. Sometimes people pickup itch mite from infested items such as bedding, clothes and furniture. The mite can survive for 48 to 72 hours without human contact. \nPeople at risk are: \nPeople living in tropical countries; \nmembers of a household who share beds; \npeople live in an institution such as prison; \npeople with suppressed immune systems such as HIV infection.",

Prolonged itching leads to the development of scabies nodules in adults; often found on the genital area, especially the penis and scrotum as well in areas around the breast. \nAdditionally, asymptomatic family members of the patient may also have burrows in the finger webs.

This is the same mosquito that transmits dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever. \nOther species of Ades mosquito Ae. albopictus, Ae. hensilli, Ae. polynesiensis were also found as vector in spread of Zika Virus. \nSome evidence suggests Zika virus can also be transmitted to humans through blood transfusion, perinatal transmission and sexual transmission. \nSome facts about Ades mosquito- \nAe. aegypti is closely associated with human environments and can breed in indoor (flower vases, concrete water tanks in bathrooms), and artificial outdoor (vehicle tyres, water storage vessels, discarded containers) environments. \nThe eggs can survive up to 1 year without water. Once water is available (even small quantities of standing water), the eggs develop into larvae and then adult mosquitoes. \nAedes mosquitoes are active during daylight hours, and usually bite during the morning and late afternoon/evening hours. \nFemale Aedes mosquito acquires the virus while feeding on the blood of an infected person. \nFemale Aedes mosquito usually flies an average of 400 metres.

Detection of Zika virus by these methods could be done in saliva or urine samples collected during the first 3 to 5 days after symptom onset, or from serum collected in the first 1 to 3 days after onset of disease. \nSerological tests, (immunofluorescence assays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays) may show the presence of anti-Zika virus IgM and IgG antibodies. DIAGNOSIS by serology is difficult as the virus can cross-react with other flaviviruses such as dengue, West Nile and yellow fever. \nIn India, National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Delhi and National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, have the capacity to provide laboratory DIAGNOSIS of Zika virus disease in acute febrile stage.

As compared to Dengue, cases of Zika virus infection has a mild to moderate clinical picture, the onset of fever is more acute and shorter in duration. \nIncreased cases of Guillain-Barré syndromea (GBS) in general public and microcephalyb in newborns were reported from French Polynesia and Brazil during Zika outbreaks in 2013-2014 and 2015 respectively. Medical experts suspected an association of micocephaly and GBS with Zika virus infection. But no scientific evidence confirms a link so far*. \n(a. Guillain-Barré syndrome-It is a condition in which the body’s immune system attacks part of the nervous system. It can be caused by a number of viruses and can affect people of any age.
